## What did i learn 
* structured the backend folder.
* found some faults and incomplete codes,inside backend folder,read about how to fix it .
* learnt how to call  one function of a code from the other file
* wrote the health route function.
* learnt some new keywords and concepts.


**Problems and solution**
* wrote  an average code for the health route where it returned only the status 
 
  made it better by adding  some new concepts like `uptime`,`environment`,`message`,etc;
* There were some faults in the code which are as follows :
*  I was checking which are git repos or not but never thought it can return git subfolers  also because they are also git repos.

     So we have to return the git root repo
* i  wrote the conditions for checking if the branches existed 

    it shoud be that the branches must be of the particular git repo and i have to send the branches also fr the user 
* Have to keep a check condition so that the outputs don't exceed the limits of words.
