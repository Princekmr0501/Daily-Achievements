## what did i learn 
* modified the git repo's name and tried to rename the project which was not done .
* made a database postregsql and connected it through Prisma 


**Problems and Solutions**
* To establish a connection between the server and the database(postgresql) we had to use the commnad `prisma migrate --dev ` and to use these commnads we have to install a specific tool which give access for these types of various commands 
* server was not running because one of the dependencies needed eslint version 10 so updated the dependency's version.
* didn't mentioned the username and password inside the Dataurl of the database so postgresql was throwing an error ,so modified the database url with username and password 
*
