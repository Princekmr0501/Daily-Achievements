## what did i learn 
* learnt about lint fixing 
* learnt about difference netween npx and npm
* learnt about some commands which can directly lint fix all the files 

**Problems and solutions**
* was installing simple eslint but found that we have to install Eslint+Typescript for this project .
* eslint was not running the typescripts files so modified the `package.json` by putting the following commands inside  scripts .
