##  Test cases and Error Handling
* `return` statement can be used inside switch but for that you have to wrap up the whole function inside function main and call it 
* Don't let the invalid cases come inside the switch,(we can handle the invalid cases with default but its prefferable to handle it outside the switch)
* eslint--plugin help catch problem likes wrong or duplicate file import ,catching dev dependicies if theyare installed in production,catching circular dependcies extra .
