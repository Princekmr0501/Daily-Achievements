 ## What did I learnt 
 * How to handle the linting problems 
 * How to fix The test cases 
 * cleared my understanding and made me understandand how a clean and neat js code looks like
 *  How work is done on a real project 
 
 
 **Problems**
**Linting Problem**
* `import/no-dynamic-require`,this error was 
displaying in the Terminal 

 **Solution**
 * This is the import problem ,either use fs while importing or write the following code inside `eslint.config.mjs`.

 **Problem**
 * Test Case Problems, arose while handling the Test Cases like existing user or wrong variable name
* Invalid field error
Printed "Invalid Email" instead of expected regex match
* invalid field error
CSV rewritten & success message printed even for invalid field
* duplicate email
Extra space / typo in message "email exists "
* success messages
Multiple / inconsistent messages → test fails exact output check
 
 **Solution**
 * Reffered different materials about the test cases problems and fixed the test cases.
