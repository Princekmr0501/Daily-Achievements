 ## Git 
 * A version control system- means we can go back and **track as well as manipulate** the previous changes 
 * **.git**  is a very important file as all the changes are tracked and saved inside this file 
 * git uses very less memory as it only **takes the space of the changes made and commited** not the entire file again.
 * git can **work without internet**.
 *  various people can work on the **same project at the same time through branches**

 * Github is a place **where people collaborate for working on the same project** .
 * Collaborators assume main project on github only as the main **source of truth**.
