## What did i learn 
* Worked on listing the directories 
* Fixed the most of the code 

**Problems and Solutions**
* A lot of error was coming after writing the code of listing the directories like 
* Handled and fixed  the condition that if the results command ran before git commands execution.
* Path used inside one function and is used in other function,so made the path function global 
* Handling the err and isDirectory individually which led to send various responses to the frontend ,so merged the both condition into one condition and returned one respond.
* git sends the response "true" not "True
* was incorrectly using pending and join ,so learnt to used it correctly.
