## What did I learn
* Worked on how to send and recieve the data from AI 
* learnt about the following terms :
* `module.exports = router`
* `require("dotenv").config()`;

**Problems and Solutions**
* There were problems arising related to asynchronous functions.
so to overcome this problem we can wrap the `async` functions in a Promise .
