## what did i learn 
* completed the final listing directories 
* learnt about how repo id's are used in real world to track the paths of the
folders.
* how to send and get back the response from chatgpt 

**Problems**
* My thought process was that I would  execute the command, caputure the code in variables and send these variables's data to the chatgpt for reviewing.

**Solutions**
* But here we have to keep a check on some conditions,for i.e data stored inside the variable can become too big and messy so send only the important data not the whole data.

* use `execFile` instead of `exec`as it is considered more safer
