## Worked on Project 
**gained some practical knowledge for completing this project**
* module is like a container which contains functionns
* There are various types of built -in -module like-fs,readFileSync,writeFileSync,existsSync
* `.some` is used to check if atleast anyone element matches the condition in Array. 
* `.some` dont return any value ,it only checks and returns true or false 
* `.find` is used to find the first element that matches the condition.
* Converting a string argument in a number i.e Number(process.argv[2]);
* NaN checks if its a valid number or not ,basically checks its a number or not.

**Project Improvement**
