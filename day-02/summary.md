* practiced each and every command

## What I understand 
* uses of each and every command 
* How to use the commands
* Differnce between cloning and linking 


## what problems came and their solutions
* **Problem** -commiting got rejected due to different number of commits in local and remote repo respectively
 
  **Solution**-fetched the commit from remote repo and merged with the commit from local repo and then pushed it it remote repo.

 * **Problem**-merging problem as both the commits were of unrelated histories 
  
   **Solution**-ran a command **`git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories** `,this completed the merge.
