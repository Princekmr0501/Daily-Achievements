## What did i learn
* learnt how to install and use  Typescript 
* optimized the `js` codes to `ts`codes for a safer code 

**Problems and Solutions**
* made the `dist` folder in the wrong dirrectory and ran the `npm init ` command which    made a extr `package.json`.
 * so again went indside the main directory , did all the steps again ,deleted the extra `package.json` which modified the previous `package.json`.
