## Started a server and ran the code for a valid directory
* To start a sever require the express framework and make it listen to a specific port number 
* Took the request from the server, required its path using query ,checked if its a valid query using fs.stat(isDirectory).
* learnt that the `err` condition should always be entertained first inside every function.
