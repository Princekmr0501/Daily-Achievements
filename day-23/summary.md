## what did i learn 
* use of Promises.all
* used `env` file and learnt about `dotenv` 
* started writing the function calls of askllm for communicating with the llm.

**Problems and the solution**
* Problems came while  writing the code for askllm.
* some problems arose in writng the `POST` method ,so learnt about he diffrent terms such as headers,authentication and how to send and accesss the request in json format.
* Also problem arose while  processing the `API KEY` and in which file  should we acquire `dotenv`
* learn to process the `API KEY` and `dotenv` file should must be present inside `app.js`
