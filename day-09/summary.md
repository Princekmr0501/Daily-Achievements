## What i learned 
* Learned async and await to handle time-taking tasks in JavaScript.
* Used fetch with async/await to get data from APIs.
* Handled errors using try–catch.
* Learned AJAX, which fetches data without refreshing the page.
* Axios, a library that makes AJAX requests easier and works in both browser and Node.js.

 
## what problems came and their solutions
* **Problem** -**AJAX Concept**
* Confusion between AJAX and fetch/Axios (AJAX is a concept, fetch/Axios are tools).
* Expecting the page to refresh automatically after data loads.
* **Solution**- searched the resources to get the better idea and clear understanding .

* **Problem** -**Axios**
* Forgetting to install Axios in Node.js (npm install axios).
* Not understanding that Axios already parses JSON.
* Mixing Axios syntax with fetch syntax.
* **Solution**-referred the video lectures to install Axios  and went through different resources to get a clear picture of Axios.
