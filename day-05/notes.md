## What is REST
* REST is a way to design HTTP based APIS.
* These Apis in a request reponse fashion using HTTP 

## The Six Constraints
* Uniform Interface- an interface between client and server 
* Stateless-server dont need to keep info about user as all the data is provided in the https requests
* Cacheable-  a response can be used till a specific time 
* Client-Server- Frontend and Backend are separate 
  UI -used by client side 
  Server-backend part 
* Layered System- Users dont about how many servers are running behind.
* Code on Demand-Code on Demand means server sends code, not just data.
