## what did i learn 

* used  postgresql databases inside local machine and  made use of online database`Neon`
* fetched the health route from the frontend 
* learnt how to connect prisma and backend server to `Neon` 

**Problems and solutions**
* Prisma v6 can directly connected to the database but in Prisma v7 we cannot connect directly to the Neon database ,in Prisma v7 first prisma will connect with a Adapter and that adapter will be connected to the Neon database .
* Was running wrong query for accesing the table so corrected it .
